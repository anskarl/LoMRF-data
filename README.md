# LoMRF-data: Data Files Companion Project for LoMRF

This is a companion project for the [LoMRF](https://github.com/anskarl/LoMRF) (Logical Markov Random Fields) which contains example files (sample knowledge bases and evidence data), as well as files that are needed for Unit testing LoMRF. LoMRF is an open source implementation of [Markov Logic Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_logic_network) (MLNs).

Please note that all example files are part of the documentation of [LoMRF](https://github.com/anskarl/LoMRF). The example files are separated into the following categories:
  1. Files for performing probabilistic inference (see [Probabilistic Inference Documentation](https://github.com/anskarl/LoMRF/blob/master/doc/2_inference.md)).
  2. Files for weight learning (see [Weight Learning Documentation](https://github.com/anskarl/LoMRF/blob/master/doc/3_weight_learning.md)).
  3. Files for structure learning (see [Structure Learning Documentation](https://github.com/anskarl/LoMRF/blob/master/doc/4_structure_learning.md)).
  4. A collection of sample files that represent input example cases for Unit Tests.
